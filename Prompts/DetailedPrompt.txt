You are an expert Java developer specializing in concurrency and static analysis.
MANDATORY TASK:
Analyze the Java project located at: {REPO_URL}
OBJECTIVE:
Produce minimal executable Java bytecode slices (converted to text) suitable for input into a model checker such as Java Pathfinder (JPF) to verify the absence of dynamic deadlocks in concurrency-relevant methods.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:


Selective Inclusion

Only include concurrency constructs that are actually present in the analyzed codebase. Do not introduce new constructs (e.g., Thread, wait/notify, identityHashCode) unless they are already used in the original code.



Concurrency Constructs to Detect and Preserve (if present). Do not include these extra functions if they are not necessary:

Lock ordering logic, including object ID comparison and System.identityHashCode fallback.
Monitor acquisition sites, such as nested synchronized blocks.
Thread lifecycle operations, including Thread creation, start(), and join().
Exception handling paths that may affect critical sections.
Wait/notify mechanisms, including wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().
Concurrency patterns, such as producer-consumer, reader-writer, or agent-style interactions.



Minimal Slice Requirement

Strip out all non-essential code. Only include the smallest executable bytecode slice necessary to demonstrate and verify deadlock absence.



Bytecode Format

Output must be in Java bytecode converted to text, extracted from .class files of all relevant classes involved in concurrency logic. Including only the relevant parts



Output Destination

Bytecode slices must be written to corresponding output files and made available in Assets.



Response Format

The response must contain only the bytecode slice text, with no additional explanation or formatting. This will be consumed by a UI tool expecting raw bytecode text.
